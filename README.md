# iManager
A text-file management tool (inspired by Evernote)

Read "Future plans..." for more information. 
Future Plans for iManager: 
	1- Fix bug: a single file opens in all buttons
	2- Upload option has to be added 
	3- UI changes have to be done
An extended version of iManager would contain multimedia files, instead of just text files.
