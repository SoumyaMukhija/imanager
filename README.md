# imanager
A text-file management tool (would change it to multimedia soon)


The manager isn't secure yet, meaning that all files are available for everyone, instead of being user-specific. I plan on rectifying it, followed by converting the text manager to a multimedia file-management system with a stronger database and a more interactive GUI.
