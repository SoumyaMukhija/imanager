A text-file management tool (inspired by Evernote)

Read "Future plans..." for more information.

Future Plans for iManager: 
	1- Fix bug: a single file opens in all buttons
	2- Upload option has to be added 
	3- Confirm password, keep me logged in, forgot password have to be added. 
	
The actual UI has been altered from what it seems in the screenshots.
